#here is a txt file

git status
#tells you what has changed since your last commit

How do you start tracking?
git add FILE
#now it's ready to be commited

git commit -m "add this FILE"
git status after this will...
#show nothing really


git workflow
#Do a little bit of work, stage it (add) and make a commit (with a message)
